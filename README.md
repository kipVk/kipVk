### Hello!

I'm a Telecommuncations Engineer who has been working few years as Technical Director in the animation industry. Now I'm currently a student at Hive Helsinki, focusing on my programming skills, and looking for new opportunities as a software engineer or a product manager as my previous experience combined both skillsets.

I'm currently working on the web development branch at school after finishing the 2 weeks php bootcamp.

Languages I love:
